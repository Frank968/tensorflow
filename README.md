AI-> ML -> DL:DL is a newer area of ML that that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to deliver high accuracy in tasks 
such as object detection, speech recognition, language translation Detecting fraud or evaluating risk .
a method of statistical learning that extracts features or attributes from raw data sets,  data science 

Model:
Input -> extract -> classification(seperate) -> regression (output)

Method:
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks.

a generative network and a discriminative network: generate realistic speech 
Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP):run chatbots


(1) Supervised Learning:labeled data , directed feedback, predicat output
(2) Unsupervised Learning: no labeled data, no feedback, find hidden pattern (clustering and association)
(3) Reinforcement Learning:decision progress, reward and punishment, learn action (observation and trial & error to achieve goals or maximize reward)


Label, training, overfitting is underfitting, save and restore,

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
